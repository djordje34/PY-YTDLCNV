Collection of scripts for downloading yt videos and converting them to mp3

tube.py deals with the downloading part of the problem by having a txt file which contains URL's pointing to selected videos, iterating through it and simultaneously downloading each video.

conv.py converts all the files in selected directory to mp3 format.
